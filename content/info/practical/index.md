## About the course

This course is a hands-on practical introduction with no prerequisites in applying computer science techniques (like programming and machine  learning) in humanities and social science research. It will cover a broad range of techniques and methods representing the latest methodological innovations in social science and humanities applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

The course is meant as a hands-on tools workshop focusing on the practical application of these methods and will not go in depth with the mathematical and theoretical foundations. It will rather provide a broad overview of the data science ecosystem and toolbox. We do not expect you to be able to immediately implement the methods in your own research, but the course should provide a good jumping-off point for starting to integrate these methods.



## Teaching format

**Interactive notebooks and live coding**

Teaching consists of a mixture of lectures and exercises using interactive online notebooks on Google Collab allowing you to try out and use the various methods as they are being taught. Exercises consist of both live coding and adapting code to solve specific problems or create specific outputs.



**Portfolio work**

Each day you are given an hour to work on a portfolio with the possibility of sparring with the course lecturers. Here you are expected to solve a limited number of problems using the methods and tools taught during the given day by writing your own code in a notebook.

Two weeks after the end of the course (December 10th 2021), you are expected to hand in your combined  portfolio (the notebook(s) containing all your code) in order to receive  credits.





## Online forum (Slack)

To provide assistance and foster discussion leading up to and during the course, we have set up a [Slack](https://slack.com/) workspace for the PhD course. Use this as a forum to post questions about Python, the e-course material and the sessions as well as a general forum for discussion.

If you have not received a link to the Slack workspace, please contact Kristian Gade Kjelmann (<a href="mailto:kgk@adm.aau.dk">kgk@adm.aau.dk</a>).
