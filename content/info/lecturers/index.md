Associate Professor in Innovation Studies and Data Science at Aalborg University.

Having a background in engineering, I somehow became an economist, interested in the economics of technological change. Nowadays, my research is mainly centered around the application and development of computational methods to map, visualize, and analyze its causes and consequences. These methods range from traditional econometric modeling and agent-based simulation, over network and complex system modeling, to novel predictive modeling and deep learning techniques. Since 2018 together with Roman Jurowetzki, I am coordinating the [Social Data Science specialization at AAU](https://www.sds.aau.dk/), where we train business and social science students in the application of computational methods. In adittion, I am involved in a range of initiatives to promote the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence methods in social science and the private sector.

Associate Professor in Innovation Studies and Data Science at Aalborg University.

I come from a crossdisciplinary social science background. After my master in innovation economics I was rather frustrated by the underutilization of unstructured data in the field of my PhD project. This was until I discovered Natural Language Processing in 2013. I have been utilizing text and other unstructured data ever since in my research. Recently that has beeen research related to mapping and understanding of complex technological ecosystems. Since 2018 together with Daniel Hain, I am coordinating the [Social Data Science specialization at AAU](https://www.sds.aau.dk/), where we train business and social science students in the application of computational methods.

General Manager of [CALDISS](https://www.en.caldiss.aau.dk/) at Aalborg University.

During my master in sociology I discovered the various potentials of digital methods and programming tools - especially in text analysis. I wrote my masters in higher education organisation using self-taught methods from text mining and the like.
I now run CALDISS (Computational Analytics Laboratory for Digital Social Science) at the Faculty of Social Sciences at Aalborg University, where I promote and teach the potentials in digital methods and data science to our researchers and students while collaborating and engaging in cross-disciplinary research projects using data science methods.

Assistant Professor at Sociology and Social Work at Aalborg University.

I have a background in sociology. After my master in sociology of education I was employed as a PhD fellow at Aalborg University, Department of Sociology, where I worked on spatial inequality using register data in combination with spatial clustering to better understand the flow and changes of socioeconomic inequality. After my recent PhD defense I continue to work at sociology by exploring the possibilities of combining satellite image recognition with register data to form models that helps us understand how micro level neighborhood change and (d)evolve over time.

### {{<rawhtml>}}<a id = "jankinne"></a>{{</>}}[![jankinne](/sdsphd20/img/jk_head.png) Jan Kinne](https://www.zew.de/en/team/jki/)

Jan Kinne has been a member of the ZEW Research Department “Economics of Innovation and Industrial Dynamics” since June 2016. He studied geoinformatics at Heidelberg University and Loughborough University, UK. In the context of his dissertation (Dr. rer. nat.) at the University of Salzburg, which he successfully completed in September 2020, he developed web-based innovation indicators for microgeographic analyses. He continues to conduct method-oriented research on the use of (text-based) web data for innovation research. In 2019 he co-founded istari.ai, a startup that specializes in web-based company and market information in real-time.
