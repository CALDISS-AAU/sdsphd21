**Portfolio work**

Each day you are given an hour to work on a portfolio with the possibility of sparring with the course lecturers. Here you are expected to solve a limited number of problems using the methods and tools taught during the given day by writing your own code in a notebook.

At the end of the week, you are expected to hand in your combined portfolio (the notebook containing all your code) in order to receive credits.



*HANDING IN YOUR PORTFOLIO IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO RECEIVE YOUR CERTIFICATE AND ECTS CREDITS*



**How to hand in your portfolio notebooks**

You can hand in your portfolio notebooks in two ways (see the video below for a walkthrough):

1. Saving your notebooks in a GitHub repository and then sending the repository URL to the course organizer (Kristian Kjelmann)
2. Sharing your notebooks directly with the course organizer (Kristian Kjelmann) in Google Colab.
