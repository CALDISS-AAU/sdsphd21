## About the curriculum

Here you will find the e-course curriculum. The e-courses are provided by <a href=https://www.datacamp.com/ target="_blank">DataCamp</a>.

DataCamp e-courses consist of a combination of video lectures and hands-on exercises, where you will have to solve small coding problems.

We strongly advice participants to complete as much as the mandatory course curriculum as possible. A lot of the same methods will be covered during the course but getting a feel for how python programming works before-hand allows you to get even more out of the PhD course.

If you are participating in the course, you should have received a DataCamp invite via the e-mail you registered with (make sure to check your spam filter).

Please contact Kristian Gade Kjelmann (<a href="mailto:kgk@adm.aau.dk">kgk@adm.aau.dk</a>), if you have not received an invite.
