## About the portfolio

Each day you are given an hour to work on a portfolio with the  possibility of sparring with the course lecturers. Here you are expected to solve a limited number of problems using the methods and tools  taught during the given day by writing your own code in a notebook.

Two weeks after the end of the course (December 11th 2020), you are expected to hand in your combined  portfolio (the notebook(s) containing all your code) in order to receive  credits.

*Handing in your portfolio is required in order to receive your certificate and ECTS credits*.



## Requirements

You are expected to *attempt* to solve the various assignments using the methods and tools taught during the course. Solutions should be combined into a single notebook or series of notebook.

What we mean by attempt is that we are not evaluating you based on a specific solution. We are evaluating solely on trying to make code work for the different assignments. It is therefore acceptable that a portfolio does not have a perfect or complete solution for the assignments, as long as it demonstrates attempts to solve them.

**Note:** You are not expected to attempt to solve every single assignment. Note the different requirements for each day on the [sessions page](https://caldiss-aau.github.io/sdsphd20/sessions/).

**Deadline**: December 11th 2020



## Portfolio assignments

The portfolio assignments can be found in this portfolio notebook: (links to Google Colab): [Portfolio assignments](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CALDISS-AAU/sdsphd20/blob/master/notebooks/portfolio/sdsphd20_portfolio-assignments.ipynb#&offline=true&sandboxMode=true)

The notebook contains the various assignments assigned throughout the week. You can use this notebook as a template for your portfolio and fill in your solutions.

Note that there are different requirements for each day. *You are not expected to attempt to solve all the assignments!*



## Handing in your portfolio

You can hand in your portfolio notebook(s) in two ways (see the video below for a walkthrough):

1. Saving your notebooks in a GitHub repository and then sending the repository URL to the course organizer (Kristian Kjelmann)
2. Sharing your notebooks directly with the course organizer (Kristian Kjelmann) in Google Colab.
